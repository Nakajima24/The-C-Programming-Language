Exercise 3-1. Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.

Exercise 3-2 Write a function escape(s,t) that converts characters like newline and tab into
   visible sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string s to t. Write a function
   for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.
